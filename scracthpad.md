// how to create custom rules for problems which work equally across all supported languages;

Use JSON as the common denominator

Use rules like: 
 - must contain prop "name" with value "John Doe"'
 - must contain prop "age" with value 35
 - must contain prop "favFoods" with value ["horse", "chicken", "fish"]
